/**
 * <p>
 * Definition of an interface that can be used for search queries spanning
 * multiple server invocations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some search queries can be too expensive to search all existing entities at
 * once. In this case an object implementing this interface can be used to store
 * all information about the current search position. The idea is that the
 * server creates a {@code SearchIterator} object and returns it to the client
 * together with the results retrieved so far. Based on the methods defined in
 * this interface the client can find out whether the search is complete or
 * there are still remaining elements to be searched. In the latter case the
 * client can invoke the search method another time passing in the same iterator
 * object. From the data stored in the iterator internally the server is able to
 * continue the search at the very same position. This communication can happen
 * in a loop until search is complete.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The basic motivation is that search results already drop in while the search
 * is still in progress. So the user gets feedback soon, and the application
 * appears to be more responsive.
 * </p>

     * However, depending on the current search information about pages may not
     * be available, e.g. if the search is not complete yet and therefore the
     * total number of results is unknown. In this case this method can return
     * <b>null</b>. The view on the client can then only know whether there is a
     * next and a previous page. This method is typically used together with
     * {@link #getPageCount()} to implement paging functionality. An
     * implementation of this interface must either return non-<b>null</b>
     * values from both methods or <b>null</b> - so paging is either supported
     * fully or not at all.
