/**
 * A test implementation of an actor which stores all messages received in a
 * blocking queue. Clients can query this queue to retrieve the messages in a
 * thread-safe way. This class can be used by unit tests if messages are sent
 * by different threads.
 *
 * It is possible to pass in a partial function which is evaluated before the
 * message is stored in the internal queue. This makes it possible to handle
 * certain messages in a specific way while others are just stored as they are.
 * Note that all messages are stored, even if they could be handled by the
 * partial function.
 *
 * @param messageHandler the message handler function
