/**
 * <p>
 * A class for buffering audio data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is used for buffering audio data that can be obtained from a CD
 * ROM or over the network on the user's hard disk. It reserves a buffer of a
 * configurable size at a given directory. This buffer is divided in a number of
 * chunks (which can also be configured). Each chunk corresponds to a physical
 * file in the data directory. The buffer can be filled with data through the
 * methods of the {@link DataBuffer} interface. When data is added temporary
 * files for the chunks are created if necessary. If the the buffer is full,
 * write operations will block.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Concurrently data can be read via streams obtained through the methods of the
 * {@link AudioStreamSource} interface. These streams point to the data files
 * created for the single chunks. (In fact they are instances of the
 * {@link ChainedInputStream} class, that allows to treat the content of
 * multiple chunk files as a single stream.) If the buffer is closed, an empty
 * stream will be returned by {@code nextAudioStream()}. This can be used by a
 * client to determine when there is no more data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When ever a chunk has been completely read the corresponding file is deleted
 * from the data directory. Its space is then available for a new chunk file. So
 * if there are blocking write operations, the corresponding threads can then
 * continue with their work. This way the size of the buffer remains constantly
 * under the specified limit while data is concurrently read and written.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An exception to this rule can occur when the mark operation is used on the
 * audio stream. In this case data that has been marked cannot simply be
 * removed. So if further data is requested, it will be loaded into the buffer,
 * even if its size limit is reached. If this is necessary and how many data
 * must be re-read during a mark operation depends on the audio format.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class supports a single reader and a single writer thread. In that way
 * it is thread-safe, i.e. data can be concurrently read and written.
 * </p>
