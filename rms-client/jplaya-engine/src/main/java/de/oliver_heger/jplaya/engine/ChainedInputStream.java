/**
 * <p>
 * A specialized input stream implementation that allows access to an arbitrary
 * number of child streams, whose date is sequentially read.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With this stream it is possible to combine multiple input streams to a single
 * one, which is useful when a large file is split into multiple parts. Child
 * streams can be added using the <code>addStream()</code> method. For each
 * stream the number of bytes to be read can be specified. So it is possible
 * that streams are only partly read.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The implementation is thread-safe, i.e. it is possible to add new child
 * streams while data is read (however read operations on the stream are only
 * allowed for a single thread). When a child stream is completely processed,
 * optionally a call back method can be invoked, notifying an interested
 * listener about the progress. The current number of read bytes is also
 * calculated.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The stream also supports the <code>mark()</code> operation if the contained
 * streams also support this feature.
 * </p>
