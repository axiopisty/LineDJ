/**
 * <p>
 * A helper class for connecting a {@link PlaylistManager} with the audio player
 * engine.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class implements some functionality which is typically needed when using
 * the audio player engine to play the songs defined by a playlist. It
 * implements the {@link AudioStreamSource} interface in a way that the songs in
 * the order defined by a {@code PlaylistManager} are returned. In addition it
 * keeps track on the songs actually played. It does so by storing a
 * {@code PlaylistManager} which is obtained from the
 * {@link PlaylistManagerFactory} passed to the constructor. This
 * {@code PlaylistManager} can be queried and even manipulated by other
 * components which are interested in the current playlist. (Actually two
 * playlist managers have to be maintained: one for the audio source, and one
 * for the songs currently played. The first one is typically some songs before
 * the other one because songs are buffered on the local hard disc before they
 * are played. The {@code PlaylistManager} exposed by the
 * {@link #getPlaylistManager()} method is a wrapper which ensures that the
 * playlist managers used internally are in sync with status changes performed
 * by external components.)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class also implements an auto-safe feature. After a configurable number
 * of songs has been played, the state of the playlist manager is saved
 * automatically. For this to work the class implements the
 * {@link AudioPlayerListener} interface so that it can be notified when a songs
 * has been played. Client code is responsible for registering an instance as
 * listener at an audio player.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Another feature is a smart handling of backwards commands: When the current
 * playlist manager is told to move to the previous song the current position in
 * the currently played song is checked. If it is before a configurable time
 * span, the manager actually moves to the previous song. Otherwise, the current
 * song is played again from start.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: This class can be used in an environment with multiple
 * threads. (Typically events from the audio player arrive in different threads.
 * The class can handle this.)
 * </p>
