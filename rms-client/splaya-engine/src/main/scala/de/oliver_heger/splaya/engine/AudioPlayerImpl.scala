/**
 * The default implementation of the ''AudioPlayer'' trait.
 *
 * This implementation controls communication between a couple of actors and
 * the passed in ''PlaylistController'' object in order to provide basic audio
 * player services. The actors expect to be fed with the audio sources they
 * have to play. Therefore, the ''PlaylistController'' must have been
 * initialized correctly to pass the current playlist to the right actor. This
 * class mainly interacts with the [[de.oliver_heger.splaya.engine.PlaybackActor]]
 * actor; it is send messages to pause or resume playback in reaction of
 * corresponding method invocations. The
 * [[de.oliver_heger.splaya.engine.SourceReaderActor]] actor is expected to be
 * passed the current playlist. When the audio player is told to move to another
 * position in the playlist it is sent a flush message.
 *
 * From client code, a typical usage scenario of this class is as follows:
 * - ''readMedium()'' is called to read the content of the source medium. This
 * starts playback automatically.
 * - Depending on user actions, the methods for pausing and resuming, or for
 * navigating in the playlist can be called.
 * - ''readMedium()'' can be called again to construct a new playlist (from the
 * same or a different medium).
 * - Before the application exists, ''shutdown()'' should be called.
 *
 * @param gateway the gateway object
 * @param playlistController the object managing playlist information
 * @param timingActor the actor responsible for timing
 * @param eventActor the actor responsible for event translation
 * @param moveBackwardThreshold a time (in milliseconds) which controls the
 * behavior of the ''moveBackward()'' operation: this method checks the current
 * playback time; if it is less than this value, it moves back in the playlist
 * to the previous audio source; otherwise, the current audio source is played
 * again
