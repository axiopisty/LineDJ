 * this data (e.g. for obtaining ID3 tags), the reads are slowed down. To
 * ensure that playback is not interrupted, the source reader actor must have
 * priority. Therefore, other components which also need access to the source
 * medium should observe this messages and interrupt their activities if the
 * source reader locks the medium (in this case the ''lock'' parameter is set
 * to '''true'''). After copying a chunk from the source medium, another message
 * is sent with the ''lock'' parameter set to '''false'''.
 * @param lock a flag whether the source medium is locked or unlocked
