/**
 * A specialized ''Actor'' implementation responsible for managing the
 * [[de.oliver_heger.splaya.PlaybackContextFactory]] services available in the
 * system and for creating [[de.oliver_heger.splaya.PlaybackContext]] objects.
 *
 * Concrete ''PlaybackContextFactory'' services can become available to the
 * system dynamically. (They can be removed at any time as well.) In such
 * cases corresponding messages are sent to this actor so that it can keep
 * track about the actors available.
 *
 * In addition, requests for creating a
 * [[de.oliver_heger.splaya.PlaybackContext]] can be sent to this actor. It
 * will then iterate over all available ''PlaybackContextFactory'' services
 * until one is found which supports the current audio file. This factory is
 * used to create the context. The resulting ''PlaybackContext'' object is
 * sent back to the requesting actor.
