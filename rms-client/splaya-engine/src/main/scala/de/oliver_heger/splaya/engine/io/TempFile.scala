 * A trait that represents a temporary file.

 * This trait defines some methods for the interaction with a temporary
 * file. It is possible to open both input and output streams, and to remove the
 * whole file. The idea behind this treat is that there could be multiple
 * different implementations, not only file-based, but also in-memory or
 * whatever.
