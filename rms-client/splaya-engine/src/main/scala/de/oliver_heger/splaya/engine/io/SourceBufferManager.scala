/**
 * A trait for controlling source data copied to a temporary buffer.
 *
 * During audio playback audio data is streamed from an arbitrary source to
 * a temporary buffer on the local hard disk. This trait defines the interface
 * of a controller for the temporary files which comprise the buffer. It is
 * possible to append new temporary files and to access the first one. The
 * current size of the buffer is monitored, too.
 *
 * Basically this trait is similar to a queue: new entries are appended to
 * the tail, the current entry is extracted from the head. A typical
 * implementation will also have some event notification facilities to notify
 * involved actors that files from the buffer have been read.
