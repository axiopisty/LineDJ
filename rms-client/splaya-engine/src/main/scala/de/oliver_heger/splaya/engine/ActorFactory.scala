/**
 * A trait which is used by
 * [[de.oliver_heger.splaya.engine.AudioPlayerFactoryImpl]] to create
 * concrete instances of specific actors.
 *
 * When creating a new audio player component, a number of specific actor
 * objects have to be created. This trait defines factory methods for these
 * specific actors. By delegating the creation of actors to a specialized
 * component, the audio player factory is less tightly coupled to concrete
 * actor implementations and becomes more testable.
 *
 * This implementation is already fully functional. All methods return
 * specialized actor implementations.
