/**
 * <p>
 * An abstract base class for objects which can own songs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the object model of this application there are artists and albums which
 * can be both associated with an arbitrary number of songs. The properties of
 * these entity classes are very similar (because the whole object model is
 * quite simple). Therefore it makes sense to have a common base class for these
 * concrete entity classes which already implements a major part of the
 * functionality for managing songs or other common properties.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Concrete subclasses have to define the abstract methods for setting the
 * references on {@link SongEntity} objects. These are called by the base class
 * when new songs are added or removed.
