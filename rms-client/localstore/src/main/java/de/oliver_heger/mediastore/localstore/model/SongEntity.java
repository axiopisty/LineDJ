/**
 * <p>
 * An entity class representing a song.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is used for storing songs in the local database. A song entity
 * stores a set of meta data about the song. It can be associated with an album
 * and an artist.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This entity class keeps counters for the number of times the song has been
 * played. There is one counter for the total count and one for the count since
 * the last synchronization with the server database. The latter is also used to
 * determine which songs have to be sent to the server. Normally both counters
 * are initialized when a new instance is created. However, for legacy data the
 * total count is undefined. Therefore this class contains some logic for
 * dealing with such cases.
