/**
 * <p>
 * Definition of an interface for components that control a sync operation
 * between the local database and the remote store.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link MediaStore} interface provides a means to synchronize the data
 * stored locally with data on the server. During this operation all songs which
 * have been played since the last synchronization (including new ones) are
 * retrieved and sent to the server. The synchronization runs in a background
 * thread. Because it can be a long-running operation typically visual feedback
 * has to be provided to the user and also a way to abort the process. A
 * concrete implementation of this interface can address these requirements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The basic idea is that an object implementing this interface is passed to the
 * sync operation. During synchronization, interface methods are called allowing
 * the implementation to update its state. These notifications can be used for
 * instance to implement a progress bar.
 * </p>
