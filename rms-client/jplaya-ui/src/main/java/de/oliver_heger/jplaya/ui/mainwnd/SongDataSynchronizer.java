/**
 * <p>
 * An internally used helper class for synchronizing events updating song data
 * information.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are multiple types of events requiring access to song data objects:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The {@code SongDataManager} sends events when media information about a
 * song has been extracted.</li>
 * <li>When a song has been played the corresponding data object has to be
 * retrieved.</li>
 * </ul>
 * These events can arrive in any order, e.g. a song may have already been
 * played (even multiple times!) before its media information has been
 * retrieved. So it is a bit tricky to manage song data objects and update the
 * local database at the right time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class addresses this problem. It keeps track about the songs whose media
 * information has already been fetched and about the played songs as well.
 * Internal data structures are synchronized correspondingly. Usage scenario is
 * that every time an event is received the corresponding method is called. It
 * updates the internal fields managed by this instance. If sufficient
 * information for updating the database is available, this is indicated by the
 * return value. The caller can then query the corresponding {@code SongData}
 * object from the manager and pass it to the database.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation note: This class is thread-safe.
 * </p>
